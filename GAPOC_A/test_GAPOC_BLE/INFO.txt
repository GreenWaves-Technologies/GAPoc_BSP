test_GAPOC_BLE:
==============

This example does the following :

- Configure Nina BLE module using AT command and switch to data mode
   (Nina is running its pre-flashed uCS f/w -- AT command support + Serial Service in data mode)

- Depending on the value of #define'd symbol: either send a fixed numer of vayring bytes, or receive and display a fixed number of bytes.
  For experiments, BLE interaction can conveniently occur using a smartphone using Nordic's "nRF Connect" Android application (also on iOS although in a less convenient implementation).
  
- This is repeated a number of times with the on-board green "heartbeat" LED flashing (if DIP switch position 6 is closed, to enable heartbeat LED)

- Then GAP8 puts Nina in deep sleep using pin DSR and stops 
  <*** deep sleep entry on Nina using pin DSR doesn't work OK yet ***>
